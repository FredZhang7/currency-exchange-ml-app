# Currency Exchange Application

## Created in Java for CPSC 210

I am creating a currency exchange app for this project.
Users use this app to convert an amount of money from one currency (e.g. CAD) to another (e.g. USD).
Users select two currencies from **31 unique selections**, enter the amount they want to convert in the "from" currency section, and the app will automatically display the converted amount in the "to" currency section.
This app is useful to users such as international students, travelers, and people interested in exchanging currency.

This project is interesting to me because it's an opportunity to apply my knowledge of JUnit testing, data structures, and GUI in Java. 
Also, it's an opportunity to create an app that's useful for different groups of people.
