# Currency Converter Application

## Created in Java for CPSC 210

For this project, I will create a currency converter app.
Users will be able to use this app to convert an amount of money from one currency to another.
Users will be able to select **31 unique source and target currencies**, enter the amount they want to convert in the "from" currency section, and the app will display the converted amount in the "to" currency section.
This app will be useful for users such as international students, travelers, and people interested in currency exchange rates.

This project is interesting to me because it's an opportunity to apply my knowledge of JUnit testing, data structures, file reading, and GUI in Java. 
It's also an opportunity to create an app that could be useful in everyday life.
